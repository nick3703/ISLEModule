# ISLEModule

This repo contains work on an Isle module for the SCORE NSF Grant using Marathon Data to model a Poisson process. The main working file is MarathonModule.rmd which relies on the record_table_mod.rds dataset. There are also files for our research in using Hawkes processes to explore whether World Records are 'self-exciting'.
